This document outlines the main goals we intend to reach during development. 

We have confirmed a few things about this game that would be beneficial to keep in mind during development such as:
1) This game is a Sci-Fi/Fantasy game.
2) This game is a top-down RPG (much like Zelda)
3) The combat in the game is most likely to be real time.
