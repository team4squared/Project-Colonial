A very basic, non confirmed story for our game

During the beginning of the supposed downfall of humanity, and the uprising of an advanced technological alien race
you are selectively chosen as a participant in the new "Cryo-Preservation" project. A project designed to sustain
human life for prolonged periods of time in a secret underground lair. Unfortunately, during the launch of the 
cryo-tubes into space and away from the now alien dominated, robot infested "Earth", the base at which your launch
takes place is under siege. Your cryo-pod jettisons and lands in (TBD country/place). You meet a group of scientists
who have developed a prototype device that will enable FTL travel in their newly developed spacecraft, with this
device you can take the fight right back to the alien homeworld. There is only one problem..
The aliens have taken away all the parts needed for the device to function, and without it, their rein of 
tyranny on Earth will continue. You'll have to travel to different alien bases and fight off unrelenting wards of
advanced robots they have created that were designed to take out intruders such as yourself. (Collect 4 or 5 parts)
Once you collect all the parts you travel to the alien homeworld and try to negotiate with them the terms on which
they leave Earth. You can now take two paths.  You can try to negotiate peacefully OR you can destroy the homeworld
which hosts the program that all the robots respond to. If you destroy them, however, you will fight off an 
overwhelming amount of mad aliens when you get back to Earth. They are upset at your "negotation" tactics.

End of ideas.
